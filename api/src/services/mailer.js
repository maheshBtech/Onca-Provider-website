 // @TODO Add example of an email sequence implementation
    // Something like
    // 1 - Send first email of the sequence
    // 2 - Save the step of the sequence in database
    // 3 - Schedule job for second email in 1-3 days or whatever
    // Every sequence can have its own behavior so maybe
    // the pattern Chain of Responsibility can help here.
